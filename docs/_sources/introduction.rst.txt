Introduction
============

The analysis of experimental data in the Femtomat group often requires as much time as the measurements themselves.
The purpose of this :mod:`femtomat` package is to standardize and automate many of the repetitive processes. 
The main purpose is to put the emphasis back onto the interpretation of the data rather than the analysis.

The :mod:`femtomat` package allows you to create objects from your experimental data. As the experiments result in data which has a predictable form and which
undergoes predictable analysis or manipulation, standard classes can be set up to accept and process the data.
These objects then have useful attributes which are are quickly available along with methods that can perform standard plotting and data manipulation.

Using this package we can unclutter and speed up data analysis notebooks.
